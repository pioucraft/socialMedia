# This to optimize in the code :
- In the functions, return statements must be in a "new Response thing", but don't use that when in javascript file please
- When receiving authentification, use the same function to check the handle and the token without the need to copy paste the code into multiple files (check the authentification in api.js)
- Split the inbox thing into multiple files for functions
- Split more things into multiple files and functions
- Use typescript with proper types ?
